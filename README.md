# What's this for?

This public repo is a sandbox for __demos__, __experiments__, and __proofs of concept__ created by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). Projects included here do not represent official publications or communications on the part of the National Archives.

This code is for demonstration purposes, and may not be working, maintained, or accurate—it should be assumed to be a work in progress. NARA uses this project to test potential new web pages and services which may or may not go into production.

We are happy to hear from potential audiences or users of our tools. We especially appreciate opinions on the projects that are marked below as seeking feedback—these are demos that may be ready to go live on our web site soon. 

For users without GitHub accounts, feedback can be emailed to developer@nara.gov or posted on the ICN (NARA staff only).
